# Greetings!

My name is William "Woody" Hooten.

I started my college career here at Sierra College back in 2002, continuing on to UC San Diego where I earned a [BS in Cognitive Science, specializing in Human Computer Interaction](https://i.imgur.com/v5i7GDu.jpg). I spent a decade in Silicon Valley in a variety of startups, primarily on the business side of things. Not being a developer in Silicon Valley feels a lot like riding the bench. No matter how well the team’s doing, you don’t fully feel like you were a part of the outcome. Python seems to be a major language for a lot of the things I want to do. Also, a lot of companies I worked at did some pretty cool stuff with Python, and I always found it easy to read the codebase, so I’ve been fortunate to see firsthand how powerful this language can be.
